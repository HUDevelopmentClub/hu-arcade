Imagine, it's May 22, 1980 and you're a bright-eyed 12 year old putting a quarter into a brand new Pac-Man machine. Now imagine that machine can also play Galaga, Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros, and many more games. Now fast forward to today. It's 2015, and you are standing in front of this machine.

It is the goal of the Harrisburg University Maker Club to build this retro style arcade cabinet for the students. The clubs members have embarked on a journey to bring this arcade cabinet to its students, but to do so with a modern twist. The cabinet will be a socially integrated two player retro experience for today's generation.

Here on The HU Arcade, you can follow the progress of this student built masterpiece, as it moves from a dream to a reality.
