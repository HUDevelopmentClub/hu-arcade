###Planning

HU Maker Club is planning to build an arcade cabinet for the students of the university. The Club would be responsible for designing and constructing the physical cabinet, as well as maintaining the the software and electrical components. In preparation for the building the cabinet, the club has begun designing and spec’ing out the cabinet, and its components (See Diagrams). Furthermore the club has been prototyping the software configuration of the single board computer to act as the main operating system.

###Project Description

The project is to build a retro arcade cabinet. The arcade cabinet is 70 inches in height, 36 inches in depth, and 24 inches wide. The cabinet will support up to two players at any given time in order to facilitate interaction among students.

As an attempt to get students outside of the club involved with the arcade cabinet, the club has decide to integrate a social aspect to the project . During the course of this project, students, staff, and any other parties wishing to view the progress of the cabinet will be able to follow along on both twitter, and Facebook. It is also evident to the club that even in these modern times not everyone is on social media sites. It is with that understanding in mind that the club also plans on building a companion site to unify all activity.

Alongside the social media serving as a progress check, it will also provide a public interface for students and staff to boast about their high scores. Continue with the previous sentiment of unify social media, the arcade cabinet’s site will bring together all scores in one place; essentially serving as a pseudo leader board. Adding this aspect to the project will help bring awareness to the club, and the University; as well as providing inspiration to other schools, and clubs.



###Objectives & Goals

The Clubs learning objectives include exploring concepts in CAD processing, and  wire management in a production systems. As well as provide an opportunity for students to engage in a project, and see it to fruition.

Furthermore, the arcade will help to polish student’s portfolio, exemplifying  what students have, can, and do learn at the University. Being that a student's portfolio is an integral part of University’s curriculum, it would be beneficial to all parties involved.
