###Planning

HU Maker Club is planning to build an arcade cabinet for the students of the university. The Club would be responsible for designing and constructing the physical cabinet, as well as maintaining the the software and electrical components. In preparation for building the cabinet, the club has begun designing and specifying the cabinet and its components (See Diagrams). Furthermore the club has been prototyping the software configuration of a single board computer to act as the main operating system.

###Project Description

The project is to build a retro arcade cabinet. The arcade cabinet will be 70 inches high, 36 inches deep, and 24 inches wide. The cabinet will support up to two players at once in order to facilitate interaction among students.

As an attempt to get students outside of the club involved with the arcade cabinet, the club has decided to include a social aspect in the project. During the course of the project, students, staff, and any other parties wishing to view the progress of the cabinet will be able to follow along on both Twitter and Facebook. It is evident to the club that even in these modern times not everyone is on social media sites. It is with that understanding in mind that the club also plans on building a companion site to unify all activity.

Alongside the social media serving as a progress check, it will also provide a public interface for students and staff to boast about their high scores. Continuing with the previous sentiment of unifying social media, the arcade cabinet’s site will bring together all scores in one place, essentially serving as a pseudo-leaderboard. Adding this aspect to the project will help bring awareness to the club and the University as well as providing inspiration to other schools and clubs.



###Objectives & Goals

The Club's learning objectives include exploring concepts in CAD processing and  wire management in production systems, as well as providing an opportunity for students to engage in a project and see it to fruition.

Furthermore, the arcade will help to polish the students' portfolios, exemplifying what students have, can, and do learn at the University. Being that a student's portfolio is an integral part of University’s curriculum, it would be beneficial to all parties involved.
